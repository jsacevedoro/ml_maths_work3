    "Suppose that we use a perceptron to detect spam messages. Let's say that each email message is represented by the frequency of occurrence of keywords, and the output is $+1$ if the message is considered spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Can you think of some keywords that will end up with a large positive weight in the perceptron?<br>**Solution.** Some words that will end up with large positive weight may be: discount, price, save money, buy, best price, gift, free, click here. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) How about keywords that will get a negative weight?\n",
    "<br>**Solution.** Words with negative weight might be: important, job, academic, meeting, opportunity, document.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) What parameter in the perceptron directly affects how many borderline messages end up being classified as spam?\n",
    "<br>**Solution.** The threshold or bias term $b$ is the parameter that affects the most the amount of borderline messages classified as spam, cause it represents the decision boundary."
